## Ephemeral Chat Client

This is a quick chat client with no persistence beyond the page itself. It has two chat windows for two people to use while viewing the same page which is a little useless and was done only as a CSS and JavaScript exercise.

#### See it in action [here](http://zack.io/chat).

### Technologies used:
* jQuery 3.2.0
* Bootstrap 2.1.1
